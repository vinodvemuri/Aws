2> Private Cloud : It is used to organizations bulid their data centers. In the cloud security will be very high.
3> Hybrid Cloud : It is used to both Public an Hybrid it is called as communiteycloudes.


Software Development Life Cycle:
1> Planning 2> Analysis 3> Design 4> Implementation 5> Testing & Integration 6> Maintenance
